# HotSkills - Crypto Freelance Marketplace
HotSkills is a prototype of a freelancing platform which stores it's data on blockchain.

Application is currently running on Mumbai testnet.
Smart Contract deployed at address 0x3aD0caD9E7Fb1A7A46F6F0665bbC97BdfDdaD740.

## Introduction
The idea of HotSkills was inspired by Verified Market Research, which says the freelance market size was valued at USD 3.8 billion in 2020. Growing at a CAGR of 15.02%, it is expected to grow to over USD 12 billion by 2028. I decided to promote mass adoption by attracting freelancers to the crypto industry. To attract freelancers into crypto Iâ€™m going to create a crypto freelancing platform with fast and secure payments guaranreed by smart contracts. Low fees. No middleman.

## What it does
The platform allows users to earn crypto by executing paid tasks added by others or by promoting their own services. Two types of tasks are currently available: First Come First Serve - the first user who applied will be set as an assignee, Selected by Author - the task author can select an executor from the candidate list e.g. by their ratings or based on their profile info. The task author can request changes if they are unsatisfied with the result or open a dispute for third-party result verification - TBD. Users can create their profiles to provide more info for customers. Users can add, pause/resume, or delete their services. Others can request those services.
