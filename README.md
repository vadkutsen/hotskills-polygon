# MeDo - Blockchain Freelance Platform
MeDo is a prototype of a freelancing platform which stores it's data on blockchain.

Application deployed on Netlify at [https://medo-polygon.netlify.app](https://medo-polygon.netlify.app), currently running on Mumbai testnet.
Smart Contract deployed at address 0xB8f579Bed6dc8BB35B0B02515F082b7C5dF8862F.

## Introduction
Idea of MeDo is to ease the difficulties faced by freelancers now-a-days such as unsurity about payment and high fees charged by middlemen. Blockchain can help by guaranteeing payments with help of smart contracts, providing security and an integrated payment system which can save time delays and fees in cases of international payments and its decentralised nature means there is no middleman.
